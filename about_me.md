# About me

As you have probably guessed, my name is Andrea. 
I grew up in Norrk√∂ping, Sweden, but after finishing school I moved to 
Edinburgh, Scotland where I among other things studied Philosophy and Gaelic, met my partner and had a son.

Then, it was announced that the EU referendum would happen, and it would happen very soon, and I realised that:

1. We had to move to Sweden, and we had to do it very quickly.
2. I had to become something useful.

Fast forward a few months and we now live in a flat in the Swedish countryside 
and I am a distance student of software development and operations.
It all worked out okay in the end, but for once being a bit paranoid was a good thing when we chose to not delay moving 
when people told us to do so because: "Why would anyone vote to leave the EU? That would be so stupid!".

... 

When I am not walking around in the forest or building Duplo vehicles ordered by my son 
I am really enjoying my journey towards becoming a developer. I am learning to actually do real stuff! And I haven't even left my sofa.
