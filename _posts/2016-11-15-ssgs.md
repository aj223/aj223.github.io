What do you think of static site generators?

So far, I have had a very positive experience of using the static site generator Jekyll. 
Previously, I have created HTML and CSS files in an editor and published them on a server using an FTP client. 
Compared to that approach, SSGs have a number of advantages:

1. The speed is increased since all the files are already on the web server ready to be served.
2. The approach allows for version control, which is very useful when working as a team.
3. Less likely to crash during traffic surges since serving the static site is not a very server consuming task.

These advantages may have led to Jekyll being used for the [Obama campaign's fundraising website](http://kylerush.net/blog/meet-the-obama-campaigns-250-million-fundraising-platform/) in 2011-2012.

Using static site generators has its limitations though, and the clue is in the name. 
For websites where having to reload the page in order for new content to appear is not a problem, using SSGs is fine, but if you want new content to appear automatically, such as in the Facebook feed, using SSGs is not an option.

Other limitations have to do with the file types involved. The site will consist of HTML pages, so if you want to, for example, have the ability to comment on blog posts, you have to use an external program which you cannot control.
